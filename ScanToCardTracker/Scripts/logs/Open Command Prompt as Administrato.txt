Open Command Prompt as Administrator:

If you're not already in an elevated Command Prompt, press Shift + F10 after booting into Safe Mode to open a Command Prompt window.

Navigate to the Scans folder:

Use the following command to navigate to the folder where youâ€™re facing the issue:

cd C:\Users\cwall\Desktop\CardTracker\ScanToCardTracker\Scans


Remove Read-Only Attribute:

Use this command to remove the read-only attribute from all files in the Scans folder:

attrib -r /s /d


Check Folder Permissions:

If the above command doesn't solve the issue, we can try resetting permissions with this command:

icacls "C:\Users\cwall\Desktop\CardTracker\ScanToCardTracker\Scans" /reset /T


Verify Permissions:

Ensure the cwall user has full control over the folder by running:

icacls "C:\Users\cwall\Desktop\CardTracker\ScanToCardTracker\Scans" /grant cwall:F /T


Once you've done that, try accessing the Scans folder again, and the read-only issue should be resolved.

Let me know if you encounter any issues during these steps!
