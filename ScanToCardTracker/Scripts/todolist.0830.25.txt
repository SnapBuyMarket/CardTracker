Open this file:

C:\Users\cwall\Desktop\CardTracker\ScanToCardTracker\Logs\automove_watch.log


Look at the first line â€” it tells us which folder AutoMove is actually watching. If it says OneDrive, then thatâ€™s where your pictures went. If it says Desktop, then weâ€™ll focus on the OCR side.

If the log shows it grabbed your files, peek in:

Logs\ocr_watch.log â†’ do you see your filenames listed under OCR: and OK:?

Output\ocr_results.csv â†’ do new rows appear?

If neither log shows activity, then weâ€™ll hard-lock the scripts to your Desktop folder so nothing slips into OneDrive again.

ðŸ‘‰ When youâ€™re rested, just bring me the top line from automove_watch.log and the last ~10 lines from ocr_watch.log. Thatâ€™ll tell us instantly where your files went and why nothing showed in ocr_results.csv.

Sleep well â€” Iâ€™ll be ready to pick up right where we left off.
