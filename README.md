# CardTracker

CardTracker is an Excel + VBA automation project for tracking, analyzing, and managing sports card data.  
This repository holds the workbook, macros, and supporting files for integration with eBay (and future sources).

## Quick Start
1. Put your Excel workbook inside `/excel`.
2. Enable macros on first open.
3. Keep scripts (VBA exports, Power Query M code, helpers) in `/scripts`.
4. Save images/scans to `/images` and documents/notes to `/docs`.

## Repo Layout
```
/excel    → Excel workbook(s) + macros
/scripts  → VBA modules / helpers / Power Query M
/images   → Scans and product images
/docs     → Documentation and notes
```

## Commit Tips
- Commit small, logical changes with clear messages.
- Avoid committing large ZIPs or temporary files (handled by `.gitignore`).
